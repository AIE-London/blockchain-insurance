# Incubation Notice

This project is a Hyperledger project in _Incubation_. It was proposed to the
community and documented [here](https://goo.gl/RYQZ5N). Information on what
_Incubation_ entails can be found in the [Hyperledger Project Lifecycle
document](https://goo.gl/4edNRc).

# Hyperledger Fabric

The fabric is an implementation of blockchain technology, leveraging familiar
and proven technologies. It is a modular architecture allowing pluggable
implementations of various function. It features powerful container technology
to host any mainstream language for smart contracts development.

## Releases

The fabric releases are documented [here](releases.md). We have just
released our second release under the governance of the Hyperledger Project -
v0.6-preview.

## Fabric Starter Kit

If you'd like to dive right in and get an operational experience on your local
server or laptop to begin development, we have just the thing for you. We have
created a standalone Docker-based [starter kit](starter/fabric-starter-kit.md)
that leverages the latest published Docker images that you can run on your
laptop and be up and running in no time. That should get you going with a
sample application and some simple chaincode. From there, you can go deeper
by exploring our [developer guides](#developer-guides).

## Contributing to the project

We welcome contributions to the Hyperledger Project in many forms. There's
always plenty to do! Full details of how to contribute to this project are
documented in the [Fabric developer's guide](#fabric-developer's-guide) below.

## Maintainers

The project's [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md): are responsible for reviewing and
merging all patches submitted for review and they guide the over-all technical
direction of the project within the guidelines established by the Hyperledger
Project's Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

## Communication <a name="communication"></a>

We use [Hyperledger Slack](https://slack.hyperledger.org/) for communication and
Google Hangouts&trade; for screen sharing between developers. Our development
planning and prioritization is done in [JIRA](https://jira.hyperledger.org),
and we take longer running discussions/decisions to the
[mailing list](http://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-fabric).

## Still Have Questions?
We try to maintain a comprehensive set of documentation (see below) for various audiences.
However, we realize that often there are questions that remain unanswered. For
any technical questions relating to the Hyperledger Fabric project not answered
in this documentation, please use
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger). If you
need help finding things, please don't hesitate to send a note to the
[mailing list](http://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-fabric),
or ask on [Slack]((https://slack.hyperledger.org/)).

# Hyperledger Fabric Documentation

The Hyperledger fabric is an implementation of blockchain technology, that has
been collaboratively developed under the Linux Foundation's
[Hyperledger Project](http://hyperledger.org). It leverages familiar and
proven technologies, and offers a modular architecture
that allows pluggable implementations of various function including membership
services, consensus, and smart contracts (Chaincode) execution. It features
powerful container technology to host any mainstream language for smart
contracts development.

# Developer guides

## Chaincode developer guide

- [Setting up the development environment](dev-setup/devenv.md): when developing
and testing Chaincode, or an application that leverages the fabric API or SDK,
you'll probably want to run the fabric locally on your laptop to test. You can
use the same setup that Fabric developers use.
- [Setting Up a Network For Development](Setup/Network-setup.md): alternately, you
can follow these instructions for setting up a local network for Chaincode
development without the entire fabric development environment setup.
- [Writing, Building, and Running Chaincode in a Development
Environment](Setup/Chaincode-setup.md): a step-by-step guide to writing and
testing Chaincode.
- [Chaincode FAQ](FAQ/chaincode_FAQ.md): a FAQ for all of your burning questions
relating to Chaincode.

## Application developer guide

     - [APIs - CLI, REST, and Node.js](API/CoreAPI.md)
       - [CLI](API/CoreAPI.md#cli): working with the command-line interface.
       - [REST](API/CoreAPI.md#rest-api): working with the REST API (*deprecated*).
       - [Node.js SDK](nodeSDK/node-sdk-guide.md): working with the Node.js SDK.

## Fabric developer guide

     - [Making code contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md): First, you'll want to familiarize
     yourself with the project's contribution guidelines.
     - [Setting up the development environment](dev-setup/devenv.md): after that, you
     will want to set up your development environment.
     - [Building the fabric core](dev-setup/build.md): next, try building the project
     in your local development environment to ensure that everything is set up
     correctly.
     - [Building outside of Vagrant](dev-setup/build.md#building-outside-of-vagrant):
     for the *adventurous*, you might try to build outside of the standard Vagrant
     development environment.
     - [Logging control](Setup/logging-control.md): describes how to tweak the logging
     levels of various components within the fabric.
     - [License header](dev-setup/headers.txt): every source file must include this
     license header modified to include a copyright statement for the principle
     author(s).

# Operations guide

      - [Setting Up a Network](Setup/Network-setup.md): instructions for setting up a
      network of fabric peers.
      - [Certificate Authority (CA) Setup](Setup/ca-setup.md): setting up a CA to
      support identity, security (authentication/authorization), privacy and
      confidentiality.
      - [Application ACL](tech/application-ACL.md): working with access control lists.
